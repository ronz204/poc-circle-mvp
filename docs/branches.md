### Circle | Branch Naming

To maintain an organized repository, facilitate collaborative development, and ensure an efficient workflow, we will follow a clear convention for our branch naming and a straightforward branching strategy.

We will adopt a branch naming convention that directly aligns with our commit types and the purpose of each change. This allows for quick identification of the type of work being done on a branch without needing to inspect its commits.
