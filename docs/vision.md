### Circle | Vision

****

#### Description

Circle is a social platform designed for individuals and groups to set, pursue and achieve their goals in a collaborative and structured way. Inspired by the "goal racing" concept, our vision is to create a space where motivation is amplified through mutual support, shared accountability and clear visualization of progress. Users can form “circles” with friends, family or colleagues to work on common or individual goals, sharing their journey and celebrating their collective successes.


#### Goal Racing

Within Circle, the "Goal Racing" is any individual or group actively committed to achieving a specific goal. It is not a competition in the traditional sense of “win or lose”, but a personal or group race against one's challenges and in pursuit of overcoming them.

In essence, Circle is the race track, and its users, the “Goal Racers”, are the ones who run that track with the help and encouragement of their community.

#### Problem

Today, many people face significant obstacles when trying to achieve their personal and professional goals. This difficulty is often rooted in a lack of sustained motivation, where initial enthusiasm quickly dissipates, leading to goal abandonment. In addition, the solitary nature of goal attainment can be profoundly demotivating, facilitating procrastination and giving up.

Without a clear way to visualize progress, it is difficult to maintain perspective and determine whether you are moving in the right direction, and the absence of external accountability makes it easier to postpone or abandon a goal without immediate consequences.

While there are a number of productivity tools on the market, few manage to effectively integrate the social component and group support needed to successfully track long-term goals. It is this need for a structured space that combines social support with tangible follow-through that Circle seeks to address by tackling the common frustrations that prevent people from fulfilling their aspirations.

#### Motivation

The primary motivation for creating Circle stems from a deep conviction that social support and shared responsibility are incredibly powerful catalysts for personal achievement. We have found that people are much more likely to achieve their goals when they are part of a community with similar interests or purposes, when they feel accountable not only to themselves but also to a supportive group, and when they can tangibly see the progress they are making, which reinforces their confidence and commitment.

Our goal is to build a tool that goes beyond simple goal tracking. We seek to foster human connection and collective empowerment, providing a space to celebrate small triumphs and receive encouragement in difficult moments, thus transforming the road to success into a more rewarding and effective experience for everyone.
