### Circle Vision

****

#### Description

Circle is a social platform designed for individuals and groups to set, pursue and achieve their goals in a collaborative and structured way. Inspired by the "goal racing" concept, our vision is to create a space where motivation is amplified through mutual support, shared accountability and clear visualization of progress. Users can form “circles” with friends, family or colleagues to work on common or individual goals, sharing their journey and celebrating their collective successes.


#### Goal Racing

Within Circle, the "Goal Racing" is any individual or group actively committed to achieving a specific goal. It is not a competition in the traditional sense of “win or lose”, but a personal or group race against one's challenges and in pursuit of overcoming them.

In essence, Circle is the race track, and its users, the “Goal Racers”, are the ones who run that track with the help and encouragement of their community.


#### Problem

Today, many people struggle to achieve their personal and professional goals. Often, this difficulty is due to several factors:

- Lack of sustained motivation: Initial enthusiasm fades over time, leading to goal abandonment.

- Isolation in achieving goals: Most of the time, people pursue their goals alone, which can be demotivating and make it easier to procrastinate or give up.

- Difficulty visualizing progress: Without a clear method for recording and viewing progress, it is difficult to maintain perspective and understand if you are on the right track.

- Lack of external accountability: Unless someone else is involved, it is easier to postpone or abandon a goal without feeling an immediate consequence.

- Need for a structured space: While productivity tools exist, few integrate the social and group support component effectively for tracking long-term goals.


#### Motivation

The primary motivation behind Circle stems from the belief that social support and shared responsibility are powerful catalysts for personal achievement. We have observed that people are more likely to achieve their goals when:

- They are part of a community that shares similar interests or purposes.

- They feel accountable not only to themselves, but also to a support group.

- They can tangibly see the progress they are making, which reinforces their confidence and commitment.

- They have a place to celebrate small achievements and receive encouragement in difficult times.

We want to build a tool that not only facilitates goal tracking, but also fosters human connection and collective empowerment, making the path to success a more rewarding and effective experience.
