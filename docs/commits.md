### Circle Commit Linting

Commit messages must be informative and follow a specific convention to facilitate the reading of the project history and the automatic generation of changelogs. We adopt the Conventional Commits standard.

`<type>(<scope>): <description>`

**Commit Types:**

The same types used for branches (`feat`, `refac`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`), plus some additional ones if needed: [see more](https://github.com/pvdlg/conventional-commit-types?tab=readme-ov-file#commit-types)

**Commit Scopes:**

The scope indicates the part of the project that is affected by the change. It should be concise and in lower case and some common examples include: `api`, `ui`, `test`, `deps`, `db`, `conf`
